# Sponsor Prize

## QuickNode

### Bounty Description:
Best use of NFT API ($1000)


### Please add a sentence or two on why you're applicable for this prize.
We are using QuickNode to fetch NFT Collection Details as well as NFTs by collection. The collection we are monitoring is the one we registered as Programmable IP on Story Protocol, specifying a set of on-chain rights that dictate how their content can be used or built upon by others. This process will transform their MyFitness NFTs from static images (of users doing pushups) to dynamic, extensible assets capable of interacting and composing with other assets, effectively turning them into a networked, programmable part of the digital fitness ecosystem that we can monitor via QuickNode.
