### Prize Requirements


Prize Amount: 

Bounty Description:


### Please add a sentence or two on why you're applicable for this prize.
We leveraged Story Protocol for BeFit, and its MyFitness NFTs; users' fitness journey is registered as Programmable IP on the protocol, specifying a set of on-chain rights that dictate how their content can be used or built upon by others. This process will transform their MyFitness NFTs from static images (of users doing pushups) to dynamic, extensible assets capable of interacting and composing with other assets, effectively turning them into a networked, programmable part of the digital fitness ecosystem. By utilizing Story Protocol's data structures and modules, they can facilitate licensing, create new revenue streams through derivative works, and enhance the global accessibility and liquidity of their fitness IP, all while maintaining control and transparency over how it's used and remixed.
